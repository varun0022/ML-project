Welcome to the Credit Underwriting using AI project! This cutting-edge initiative leverages machine learning to empower financial institutions with smarter decision-making in evaluating loan applicants. By predicting the likelihood of loan repayment, it enables more efficient, data-driven credit risk assessments.


## üöÄ Project Overview
This project builds a predictive model using machine learning to estimate the probability of loan default. The aim is to automate and enhance the loan approval process by accurately forecasting whether a borrower will repay the loan.

**Key Features:**
- **AI-driven Credit Risk Prediction**: Utilize historical loan data to predict credit risk.
- **Real-time API Integration**: Expose the model via an API for seamless integration with other applications.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Allow users to interact with the model and get loan predictions through a conversational interface.

## üåü Key Features
1. **Machine Learning Model** ü§ñ  
   - The model is trained using historical loan data to predict the likelihood of loan defaults.  
   - High prediction accuracy achieved using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

2. **Real-time API** üåê  
   - The model is exposed as a RESTful API through `api.py`. This makes it easy to integrate the model into other web services or systems for real-time predictions.

3. **Interactive Chatbot** üí¨  
   - The `chatbot.py` file contains a chatbot that allows users to interact with the model by asking questions like:  
     - "Is this person likely to repay the loan?"  
     - "What is the credit risk for this applicant?"

4. **Agile Documentation** üìã  
   - The project follows an Agile methodology for tracking progress and ensuring efficient delivery.  
   - Find the detailed Agile sprint plans and project management documentation in the `Agile Documentation/` folder.


##  üßë‚Äçüíª Installation & Setup



  This repository contains an AI-powered credit underwriting model that can be used to predict creditworthiness based on a given dataset. The project includes a web application to interact with the model and an API for real-time predictions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation & Setup

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository and set up

Clone the repository to your local machine by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prathapprr/Credit_Underwriting.git
cd Credit_Underwriting
```
### 2. Install dependencies

```
### 4. Run the API for Predictions

To serve the AI model and make real-time predictions via an API, run:

```bash
python api.py
```
## üß† Model Development

The **Model Building.ipynb** notebook contains all necessary steps for developing the credit underwriting model:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Analyze the dataset to detect patterns and visualize trends.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical data to ensure clean and ready data for training.

3. **Model Training**: 
   - Train various machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc., to find the best model for credit underwriting prediction.

4. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to ensure the model's effectiveness.

The trained model is then serialized and stored in `model.pkl` for easy deployment.

## ü§ñ Chatbot Integration
### Chatbot Interface

The ``chatbot.py`` file provides a conversational interface that allows users to query the model interactively. Users can ask questions like:

- "What is the likelihood this applicant will repay the loan?"
- "Can you provide a credit score estimate based on this data?"

This chatbot provides an engaging and user-friendly way to interact with the AI model and get real-time predictions based on user input.
